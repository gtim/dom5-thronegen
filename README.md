###

To do before test game:
- [x] 0pt-power: bonus wall mage
- [x] 0pt-power: change province scale
- [x] power: auto-construct a lab/temple (through events)
- [x] make the good recruitable mages slow-to-recruit
- [x] very simple throne names
- [x] minor balancing run
- [x] make a discord channel
- [ ] get buried in criticism adjust balance accordingly

### throne power ideas (both good and bad)
* permanent lab
* improve scales in neighbouring provinces
* freespawn units
* temporary global effects
  * increase world scales
  * increase/decrease world unrest
  * darkness, curse, horrormark, heal, age
* recruitable unit that's only situationally useful. e.g. bad infantry with resistances/amphibious/wings
* bonus wall defender
* negative: cause specific affliction to one(?) unit per turn (blind/NHW/eyeloss/armloss/..)

### random notes

throne powers that probably won't be included:
  * air shield - too situational
  * #heal - perhaps dubious because this is the lesser talked about way to unfeeblemind tarts and people might find this a bit wild
  * #disease
  * negative nation scales

design goals:
* make thrones a bit fresh and a little more interesting, but not whacky
* viable in vanilla games to spice things up a little, without making the mod central to the game
* throne power level: good lvl2 thrones or slightly stronger
* balanced, not swingy
