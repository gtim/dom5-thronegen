###

To do before test game:
- [ ] power: recruitable unit that's only situationally useful. maybe bad infantry with resistance
- [ ] 0pt-power: bonus wall defender
- [ ] 0pt-power: bonus wall mage
- [x] 0pt-power: change province scale
- [ ] power: auto-construct a lab/temple (through events)
- [ ] make the good recruitable mages slow-to-recruit
- [ ] minor balancing run
- [ ] very simple throne names
- [ ] make a channel and get buried in criticism, adjust balance accordingly

### misc big plans
* throne themes -- how to solve?
  * Manual tagging themes onto everything...?
    * Maybe automate tagging based on what kind of words are used for sites/units/spells associated with these tags in vanilla/DE
  * Something more exotic like finding/making a word association corpus from vast quantities of text, and seeing if it can produce something sensible...?

### bugs / stuff to fix
* underwater thrones can have recruitable non-aquatic mages
* all high-value mages should probably be slow-to-recruit -- do we have to duplicate the units?

### random notes

throne powers that probably won't be included:
  * air shield - too situational
  * #heal - perhaps dubious because this is the lesser talked about way to unfeeblemind tarts and people might find this a bit wild
  * #disease
  * negative nation scales

design goals:
* make thrones a bit fresh and a little more interesting, but not whacky
* viable in vanilla games to spice things up a little, without making the mod central to the game
* throne power level: good lvl2 thrones or slightly stronger
* balanced, not swingy
