### throne power ideas (both good and bad)
* permanent lab
* improve scales in neighbouring provinces
* freespawn units
* temporarily increased/decreased world unrest
* temporary global darkness/curse/horrormark/heal/aging
* recruitable unit that's only situationally useful. e.g. bad infantry with resistances/amphibious/wings
* bonus wall defender
* negative: cause specific affliction to one(?) unit per turn (blind/NHW/eyeloss/armloss/..)

### random notes

throne powers that probably won't be included:
  * air shield - too situational
  * #heal - perhaps dubious because this is the lesser talked about way to unfeeblemind tarts and people might find this a bit wild
  * #disease
  * negative nation scales

design goals:
* make thrones a bit fresh and a little more interesting, but not whacky
* viable in vanilla games to spice things up a little, without making the mod central to the game
* throne power level: good lvl2 thrones or slightly stronger
* balanced, not swingy
